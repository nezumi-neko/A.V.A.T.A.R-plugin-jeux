This plugin is an add-on for the [A.V.A.T.A.R](https://github.com/Avatar-Home-Automation/A.V.A.T.A.R-Server) framework.

The Games plugin is a small, versatile tool that allows you to perform several fun and useful actions:

- Roll one or two virtual dice: perfect if you are playing a game that requires dice and don’t have any on hand.
- Draw a random card from a virtual poker deck (52 cards).
- Play heads or tails with a virtual coin.
- Play Blackjack against a virtual dealer.

## Installation:

### Manual Installation:

- Download and unzip the plugin on your computer.
- If not already done, rename the last folder to games and place it directly into the plugins directory of Avatar.

### Automatic Installation:

- Use the Avatar library to download the plugin.

## How the Plugin Works:

This plugin is entirely based on randomness. Using specific key phrases, it triggers the corresponding action.
To enhance the experience, each action is accompanied by a small MP3 sound effect highlighting the event.

---

Rolling a virtual die:
`*"Keyword"*, roll a die`

---

Rolling two virtual dice:
`*"Keyword"*, roll two dice`

---

Choosing a random card from a virtual 52-card poker deck:
`*"Keyword"*, pick a card`

---

Playing heads or tails:
`*"Keyword"*, flip a coin`
`*"Keyword"*, let's play heads or tails`

At this point, Sarah will ask you to choose between heads or tails.
Words to say: "heads" or "tails"

---

Playing Blackjack:
`*"Keyword"*, play Blackjack`

At this point, Sarah will start the game.

Blackjack is a game where the player and the dealer try to get a hand as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
A 52-card deck is shuffled, and each card has a specific value: numbers (face value), face cards (10 points), and aces (1 or 11 points).
The player receives two face-up cards and can choose to "hit" (draw more cards) to get closer to 21 or "stand" (keep their hand). If the player’s points exceed 21, they lose immediately. The dealer receives one face-up card (keeping the second card hidden) and then plays, drawing cards until reaching at least 17 points.
The winner is the one with the hand closest to 21 without exceeding it. In case of a tie, it’s a draw.

Card Values:

Cards from 2 to 10 are worth their face value.
Face cards (jack, queen, king) are worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth either 11 points or 1 point (depending on the hand, to avoid exceeding 21).
